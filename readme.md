## 🧠 How It Works

1. User adds a transaction with:
   - Title (e.g., "Groceries")
   - Amount
   - Type (Income/Expense)
   - Category
   - Date

2. Transactions are:
   - Saved in localStorage
   - Displayed in a list with delete option
   - Filterable by category and date

3. The app calculates:
   - Total Income
   - Total Expense
   - Current Balance

4. Chart.js renders a dynamic donut chart to show income vs expense breakdown.

5. You can export the entire transaction data to CSV with one click.

## 📤 Export to CSV

Easily export your transaction history by clicking the **"Export CSV"** button. A `.csv` file will be generated for download and can be used in Excel, Google Sheets, etc.

## 📊 Chart Summary

The app includes a doughnut chart using **Chart.js** that visually compares income and expenses. It updates live as you add or delete transactions.
